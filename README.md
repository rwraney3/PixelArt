# PixelArt

This is the 3rd project in the "Intro to Programming" nanodegree by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/).

# Objective

The objective of this project was to create a program (JavaScript) that would

add funtion to a pre-written skeleton HTML and and it's CSS.

The HTML gives the basic introductory (black and white) screen asking for height, width and color inputs.

Once the submit button is executed, a grid of that size is drawn on the page.  In the process of creation,

addEventListener is added to each cell.  Therefore, when a cell is clicked, the background color of the

cell is changed to the selected color.  (The color can be changed mid-stream without executing the submit 

button, again.)  Once color has been added to a cell, it can be removed by selecting the cell, again.
